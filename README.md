Bus Reservation Program :

I 'm doing this program using oop's   that's why taken here  class bus 
in this first  I declare all the variables , and functions which are going to be used in this program . 
and take all the functions under public and later on call each one   . 
  b[10] means the no of buses available . 
  
  install function ::
        gives the information  of bus like bus no, its arrival, departure,  and from where does the bus goes from  and the total no. of seats 
          here  the user input data  in this but  the values must be correct like if if we have to input the total seats then it must be integer  
          and using cout for printing output and cin for getting input 
          everytime we  are inputting the data and storing it in a variable .
           and incrementing the value of p by 1.
         
  second function::
  display  the details of  bus ::which are given  in function install.
        in the third function that is the reservation of bus  here first we have to input the bus no. 
        and check whether the seat is empty or not , 
        secondly if seat is empty then enter the passengers name. and how many seats  does the passangers is booking for 
        and here also condition should be checked whether the no. of seat is in range or not .  
        if all the these conditions are succesfull then   bus is booked 
        and his seat is reserved  and total fair  according to no. of seats  is taken from him .
        
         
  at last the main function ::
  I put all the cases whether we have to book ,install, show, the details else exit from the program  by entering your choice.
